    <h2>About the brand</h2>
    <img src="../images/about/DSCF7052.JPG">
    <p> My name is Zachary Kolton, and I founded Birds Hill Burdock (BHB)</p>
    <h2>Why it started</h2>
    <p>
      In early 2023, while talking with my brother in his bedroom, I noticed he attached a strip of adhesive Velcro his tv remote.
      Until this point, my familiarity with this material did not extend passed it's uses for clothing and bags handles, so seeing this on a tv remote was strange.
      <br>
      <br>
      <i>Why did you do that?</i> I asked.
      <br>
      <br>
      and he replies... <i>It's so I don't forget where it is</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now while I did not have the same issue of forgetting <i>where</i> my tv remote was, there was an item that I forgot religiously...
      <br>
      <br>
      <i>
        my mother fucking airpod case
      </i>
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <h2>How it Started</h2>
    <p> 
      I started this brand in Feburary 2024 after inventing/idealizing a new type of Apple Airpods' case in June 2023.
      The very first version was just an airpods case with a hook-and-loop dot on the face. While it technically "worked", it was by no means a sellable idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, this brought about an entirely new chain of thought: <i>what if I just incorporate hook-and-loop material into everyday items</i>.
